Stochastic differential equation solver in C++
Michael Mitchell
July 2013

Based on the adaptive stochastic Runge-Kutta solver described in Kupper,
Lehn, and Roessler (2007) and Roessler (2003).

Solver implemented in C++ (`adaptive_srk') with a Python C extension class
wrapper (`sdepy').

`SdeFun' implements the SDE dynamics to be calculated; each dynamics
function takes the variable array pointer `x' and fills the array `dx' with
the value of the RHS of the dynamics.

`adaptive_srk' implements the function `solver', which takes initial
conditions and an SdeFun dynamics index, and fills output arrays after
integrating the dynamics using the solver described by Kupper et al.

`sdepy' wraps the C++ solver for Python.
Python function syntax: output_tuple = sde_solver(x0, dt_max, abstol, reltol, tf, m, sigma, numpaths, dynamics_mode, params)
output_tuple = (x_history, t_history, h_history, err_history, call_time)
